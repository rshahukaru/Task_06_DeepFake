Coach: The resilience. [PAUSE 300ms] Even in tough stretches, the players stayed locked in. [PAUSE 200ms] That ability to reset after mistakes [PAUSE 150ms] and finish plays late in games [PAUSE 150ms] really defined our season.
Interviewer: Any specific numbers or moments that made you say, “That’s our identity”?
Coach: Two things. [PAUSE 250ms] First, our chance creation — we consistently generated quality looks. [PAUSE 200ms] Second, late-game composure. [PAUSE 200ms] In pressure, we communicated better, [PAUSE 150ms] trusted the system, [PAUSE 150ms] and executed.
Interviewer: What’s the top priority as you prepare for the new season?
Coach: Consistency. [PAUSE 300ms] We had flashes of brilliance; [PAUSE 150ms] now we want every quarter at that level. [PAUSE 250ms] We’re sharpening conditioning, [PAUSE 150ms] speeding up ball movement, [PAUSE 150ms] and dialing in role clarity so everyone knows exactly where they create the most value.
Interviewer: And for the fans — what should they expect?
Coach: Energy, speed, and connected team play. [PAUSE 250ms] We want to build on last year and push deeper into the postseason. [PAUSE 200ms] It’s going to be an exciting ride.
